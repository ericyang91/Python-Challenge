# Python-Challenge

Please refer to the two files - Pybank and Pypoll.

These files contain codes that read directories and retrieve CSV files.
Each of these codes iterate through the CSV files, performing different calculations and analyses.

Summary of these analyses are then produced in the terminal, as well as in separate text files.
